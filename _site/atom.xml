   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-beginnings---take-two&quot;&gt;The beginnings - take two.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I wanted to talk about a blockchain technology, specifically Cardano. As for now, I am going to postpone it and work on this blog. Up ‘till now I changed the theme to lanyon from minima and uploaded it to GitHubPages. It doesn’t sound like a lot of work, but boy o boy, I am not a gifted webdeveloper at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, today I am revising how to perform an abdominal ultrasound correctly. This seemingly basic exam has its difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for my technical learning project, today is the beginning of my edx Course “ Introduction to programming with Python”. I am super psyched and can’t wait to dive deeper into this subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-beginnings&quot;&gt;The beginnings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was searching for a solution to start a blog, but I really disliked wordpress. Eventually I came across jekyll as a static site generator. This is my first try and I am far from happy with the results. I tried to change themes and got a bunch of error - messages. Stackoverflow did not have a sneaky solutation for this matter either. 
So the basic minima theme it is. But hey, it is slim, clean and … it works !!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I start rambling about Cardano and what I have learned so far. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
