### The beginnings - take two.

Actually, I wanted to talk about a blockchain technology, specifically Cardano. As for now, I am going to postpone it and work on this blog. Up 'till now I changed the theme to lanyon from minima and uploaded it to GitHubPages. It doesn't sound like a lot of work, but boy o boy, I am not a gifted webdeveloper at all.

Anyways, today I am revising how to perform an abdominal ultrasound correctly. This seemingly basic exam has its difficulties.

As for my technical learning project, today is the beginning of my edx Course " Introduction to programming with Python". I am super psyched and can't wait to dive deeper into this subject.

Stay tuned.
