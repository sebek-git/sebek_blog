### The beginnings

I was searching for a solution to start a blog, but I really disliked wordpress. Eventually I came across jekyll as a static site generator. This is my first try and I am far from happy with the results. I tried to change themes and got a bunch of error - messages. Stackoverflow did not have a sneaky solutation for this matter either. 
So the basic minima theme it is. But hey, it is slim, clean and ... it works !!

Tomorrow I start rambling about Cardano and what I have learned so far. Stay tuned.
